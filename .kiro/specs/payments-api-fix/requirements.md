# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on fixing critical issues with the payments API that are causing errors when teachers attempt to award credits to students. The primary issues include a Next.js error related to asynchronous cookie handling and a row-level security policy violation in Supabase when inserting new payment records.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to be able to award credits to students without encountering errors, so that I can properly manage student credit balances.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a teacher awards credits to a student THEN the system SHALL successfully create a payment record in the database
2. WHEN the payments API is called THEN the system SHALL properly handle cookies asynchronously to avoid Next.js errors
3. WHEN inserting payment records THEN the system SHALL properly bypass or comply with row-level security policies
4. WHEN a payment record is successfully created THEN the system SHALL return a success response with the payment details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the payments API follows Next.js best practices, so that the application remains stable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the payments API uses cookies THEN the system SHALL await the cookies() function before accessing its values
2. WHEN creating Supabase clients THEN the system SHALL use the correct approach for server components
3. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages that help identify the root cause
4. WHEN the API encounters database errors THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure proper authentication and authorization for payment operations, so that the application remains secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using service role keys THEN the system SHALL properly configure the Supabase client to bypass RLS policies
2. WHEN inserting payment records THEN the system SHALL ensure all required fields are properly provided
3. WHEN the payment API is called THEN the system SHALL verify the user has appropriate permissions
4. WHEN bypassing RLS policies THEN the system SHALL do so only for authorized operations by authenticated users
