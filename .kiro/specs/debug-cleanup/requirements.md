# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on cleaning up debugging files and resolving linting errors that are preventing the build process from completing successfully. The primary issue is with the test-jwt page that was created for debugging purposes but is no longer needed and contains linting violations that block production builds.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unnecessary debugging files, so that the build process completes without linting errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL NOT fail due to linting errors in debugging files
2. WHEN debugging files are no longer needed THEN the system SHALL remove them from the codebase
3. WHEN the test-jwt page is accessed THEN the system SHALL return a 404 error since it's been removed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix any remaining linting issues, so that the codebase maintains consistent code quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN linting rules are violated THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
2. WHEN TypeScript any types are used inappropriately THEN the system SHALL require proper type definitions
3. WHEN React components contain unescaped entities THEN the system SHALL properly escape special characters
4. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL pass all linting checks

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure no other debugging files exist, so that the codebase remains clean and production-ready.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning the codebase THEN the system SHALL identify any other debugging or test files that aren't needed
2. WHEN debugging files are found THEN the system SHALL evaluate whether they should be removed or fixed
3. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL have no unnecessary debugging artifacts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix Next.js 15 compatibility issues, so that all API routes work correctly with the latest Next.js version.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using cookies() with createRouteHandlerClient THEN the system SHALL use the async/await pattern required by Next.js 15
2. WHEN API routes are called THEN the system SHALL NOT throw cookie-related runtime errors
3. WHEN all cookie handling is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality
4. WHEN the fixes are complete THEN the system SHALL use consistent cookie handling patterns across all API routes
