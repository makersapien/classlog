# Authentication Fix Instructions

## Problem Identified

The user is logged in on the frontend (Supabase session exists) but the backend APIs are failing because JWT cookies are not set. This happened because:

1. **JWT Creation API was broken** - It was using `createAuthenticatedSupabaseClient()` which created a circular dependency
2. **Login flow incomplete** - JWT cookies weren't created during the OAuth process

## ✅ Fix Applied

Fixed the JWT creation API (`/api/auth/create-jwt`) to:
- Remove circular dependency 
- Use service role Supabase client for verification
- Properly validate user data
- Create JWT cookies correctly

## Next Steps to Restore Authentication

### Option 1: Re-login (Recommended)
1. **Sign out** from the current session
2. **Sign in again** through OAuth
3. **JWT cookies will be created** during the callback process
4. **Dashboard will work** properly

### Option 2: Manual JWT Creation (For Testing)
If you want to fix the current session without re-logging:

1. **Open browser console** on the dashboard page
2. **Run this JavaScript code**:

```javascript
// Get current user info from Supabase session
const { data: { session } } = await window.supabase.auth.getSession();
if (session) {
  // Get user profile
  const { data: profile } = await window.supabase
    .from('profiles')
    .select('*')
    .eq('id', session.user.id)
    .single();
  
  if (profile) {
    // Create JWT cookie
    const response = await fetch('/api/auth/create-jwt', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      credentials: 'include',
      body: JSON.stringify({
        userId: session.user.id,
        email: session.user.email,
        name: profile.full_name,
        role: profile.role
      })
    });
    
    if (response.ok) {
      console.log('✅ JWT cookies created! Refresh the page.');
      location.reload();
    } else {
      console.error('❌ Failed to create JWT cookies:', await response.text());
    }
  }
}
```

3. **Refresh the page** after running the code
4. **Dashboard should work**

## Verification

After fixing, you should see:
- ✅ Dashboard loads without errors
- ✅ API calls return 200 instead of 401
- ✅ User data displays properly

## Root Cause Summary

The issue was introduced when we updated all API routes to use the new Next.js 15 compatible authentication helper. The JWT creation API was accidentally updated too, which broke the login flow since it created a circular dependency.

**The fix ensures that:**
- JWT creation API works independently 
- OAuth login flow completes properly
- Backend APIs can authenticate users
- Frontend and backend authentication are synchronized

## Prevention

In the future, be careful when updating authentication helpers to ensure that:
- JWT creation APIs don't depend on the authentication they're supposed to create
- Login flow APIs remain independent of the authentication system they initialize
- Test the complete login flow after making authentication changes
