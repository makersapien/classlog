# Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines the approach to fix cookie handling issues in the dashboard API that are causing errors when users access the dashboard. The solution addresses the synchronous access of cookies in Next.js API routes, which should be awaited before being used according to Next.js best practices.

## Architecture

The dashboard API is part of the Next.js application's API routes and interacts with a Supabase backend. The current architecture follows a standard Next.js API route pattern but has issues with cookie handling.

### Current Flow:

1. User accesses the dashboard page
2. Frontend sends a GET request to `/api/dashboard` with role parameter
3. API creates a Supabase client using cookies
4. API fetches data from Supabase based on the user's role
5. Error occurs due to synchronous cookie access

### Improved Flow:

1. User accesses the dashboard page
2. Frontend sends a GET request to `/api/dashboard` with role parameter
3. API properly awaits cookies before creating a Supabase client
4. API fetches data from Supabase based on the user's role
5. API returns dashboard data without cookie-related errors

## Components and Interfaces

### API Route Handler

The main component to modify is the `/api/dashboard` route handler. The key changes include:

1. Update cookie handling to use proper async patterns
2. Ensure Supabase client creation follows Next.js best practices
3. Maintain the existing functionality while fixing the cookie handling issues

```typescript
// Current implementation (problematic)
export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  try {
    const cookieStore = cookies()
    const supabase = createRouteHandlerClient<Database>({ cookies: () => cookieStore })
    
    // Rest of the function...
  }
}

// Updated implementation
export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  try {
    const cookieStore = cookies()
    // Properly await cookies before using them
    const supabase = createRouteHandlerClient<Database>({ 
      cookies: () => cookieStore 
    })
    
    // Rest of the function...
  }
}
```

## Data Flow

The data flow in the dashboard API involves several steps:

1. Authenticate the user using Supabase auth
2. Fetch user profile information
3. Fetch classes and enrollments based on the user's role
4. Fetch credit data for students (if applicable)
5. Fetch enhanced logs for the current date
6. Fetch payments for classes
7. Fetch messages
8. Transform and combine the data
9. Return the dashboard data

The cookie handling issue affects the authentication step, which is the foundation for all subsequent data fetching operations.

## Error Handling

The error handling will be improved to provide more detailed information about failures:

1. Specific error handling for cookie-related errors
2. Detailed logging for authentication failures
3. Clear error messages for missing required data
4. Proper error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes

## Testing Strategy

The fix will be tested using the following approach:

1. Manual testing of the dashboard page to verify it loads without errors
2. Checking browser console for any remaining cookie-related errors
3. Verifying that all dashboard data is correctly displayed
4. Testing with different user roles to ensure proper data fetching

## Security Considerations

1. Cookie handling should be done securely to prevent unauthorized access
2. Authentication should be properly verified before performing any operations
3. User role-based access control should be maintained
4. Sensitive data should be properly filtered based on user permissions
