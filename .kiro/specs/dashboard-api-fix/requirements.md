# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on fixing cookie handling issues in the dashboard API that are causing errors when accessing the dashboard. The primary issue is with the synchronous access of cookies in Next.js API routes, which should be awaited before being used according to Next.js best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access the dashboard without encountering errors, so that I can view my dashboard information smoothly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard API is called THEN the system SHALL properly handle cookies asynchronously
2. WHEN cookies are accessed THEN the system SHALL await them before using their values
3. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL NOT display cookie-related error messages in the console
4. WHEN the dashboard API returns data THEN the system SHALL provide complete and accurate information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the dashboard API follows Next.js best practices, so that the application remains stable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard API uses cookies THEN the system SHALL follow Next.js best practices for cookie handling
2. WHEN creating Supabase clients THEN the system SHALL use the correct approach for server components
3. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages that help identify the root cause
4. WHEN the API encounters database errors THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure consistent cookie handling across all API routes, so that the application behaves predictably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing cookie handling in the dashboard API THEN the system SHALL use the same pattern as in other API routes
2. WHEN accessing authentication tokens THEN the system SHALL do so in a consistent manner across all routes
3. WHEN creating Supabase clients THEN the system SHALL use a consistent approach across all API routes
4. WHEN the application is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality
